            With the love of eating good food comes the long and ardous task of learning to make good food. This all started with a baking sheet and a mixing bowl in my kitchen. After months of practice, a lot of failure and a few equipment upgrades, came about my first real pizza.

            I was hooked, and despite the long time investment for each batch of pizza, I was only getting better. I went from spending over 3 hours in the kitchen to make a batch of 6 pizzas, to being able to do it in just over 1.

            I'd like to take this skill one day near or after retirement and open a little pizza place during the weekends. But even if that never happens, I'll still always enjoy making pizza at home.
